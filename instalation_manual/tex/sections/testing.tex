\section{Testing in a development environment}

If you want to test the applications before building them to a production environment, you can run them locally with the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Go to the application root folder
    \item Serve the application - \textbf{ng serve}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The command above will launch the application in the port 4200
        \item If the port is already in use, use the following command - \textbf{ng serve --port=$<$PORT$>$}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
